# AngularTemplate

This project is intended as my boilerplate template for starting new angular apps.

It already includes a few basic items such as an Auth service with a login endpoint, and an abstract API Service that sets the base for connecting to endpoints.

## Project Structure

I try to keep the project nicely stuctured as per the best practices as of this writing:

## Getting up and running

In order to get the project up and running simply run

```
ng serve
```

and you're good to go.

The project uses `yarn` so make sure that you have it installed before proceeding.
